  Task: CI/CD & Security Automation
  Instructions: Add and configure GitHub Actions workflows for CI (Node 20 build/test/lint), Docker image build/test, lint/static analysis, depcheck dependency scanning, Dependabot alerts, and CodeQL analysis. Ensure all workflows are valid, run successfully, and meet Project Puzzle acceptance criteria. Document the configuration and validate with tests.

  Requirements:
  - Add CI workflow for Node 20: install, build, test, lint.
  - Add Docker workflow: build image, run tests in container.
  - Add lint/static analysis workflow: eslint + prettier.
  - Add depcheck workflow: scan for unused dependencies.
  - Add Dependabot config for dependency updates.
  - Add CodeQL workflow for security analysis.
  - All workflows must be valid YAML and pass on push/PR.
  - Success criteria: All workflows present, valid, and passing; security/config best practices followed.
