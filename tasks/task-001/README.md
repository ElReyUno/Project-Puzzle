# Task 001: VendoVerse

## Task Description

Based on Project Puzzle acceptance criteria (non-Python, full-stack, original code, challenging tasks, Docker compatibility, and LLM difficulty), this task prioritize simplicity, scalability, and alignment with the requirements for acceptance/exit criteria.

### Technology Stack: Node.js + React (MERN stack)

Non-Python, full-stack (backend API + frontend UI), widely used, easy to Dockerize, supports multi-file changes, and has strong testing frameworks. Avoids complexity while allowing for challenging tasks (e.g., API integrations, state management).

### Repository Theme: E-commerce platform (e.g., product catalog, user accounts, shopping cart)

Provides a cohesive full-stack domain with natural task variety (features like payments, search, UI; bugs in logic; refactors for modularity; perf optimizations). Allows 10 independent tasks without overlap, meets 10+ files easily, and simulates real developer workflows.

### Task Relationship Strategy: Hybrid (e.g., 3-4 tasks on core features like user/auth, 3-4 on e-commerce logic, 2-3 independent like UI or perf)

Balances coherence (easier to maintain consistency) with breadth (covers more codebase for difficulty). Ensures tasks are independent (each starts from starter repo) while varying categories (Feature, Bug, Refactor, Perf) for scoring.

### File Count Target: 20 files

Exceeds minimum (10+), provides room for 3+ file changes per task without triviality. Breakdown: ~8 backend (API routes, models, utils), ~7 frontend (components, pages, styles), ~5 config/tests. Easier to hit 20+ lines and 10+ hunks per diff.

### Test Framework: Jest (for JavaScript/Node.js)

Matches the stack, supports AAA pattern, easy to write 6+ tests per task, integrates with npm, and validates multi-file changes. Parser-friendly for validation engine.
