  Task: Implement Product CRUD API Endpoints
  Instructions: Extend the backend API to support full CRUD operations for products. Add GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints to /api/products with proper validation, error handling, and in-memory persistence. Ensure the implementation is secure, follows RESTful conventions, and integrates seamlessly with the existing Express setup. The task must start from the clean starter repo state and result in passing tests.

  Requirements:
  - Add GET /api/products/:id to retrieve a single product by ID (return 404 if not found).
  - Add POST /api/products to create a new product (require name and price; validate price as positive number; auto-assign ID).
  - Add PUT /api/products/:id to update an existing product (validate fields; return 404 if not found).
  - Add DELETE /api/products/:id to remove a product (return 404 if not found).
  - Implement input validation (e.g., name: string, price: number > 0) and error responses (400 for bad input, 404 for not found).
  - Use in-memory storage (extend the existing products array) without external dependencies.
  - Ensure endpoints are testable via HTTP requests and align with the app's product model.
  - Success criteria: All endpoints functional, validated, and tested; no breaking changes to existing routes.
